				<h1>Hello, I am Amarine:) </h1>

					<p>
						I am a bilingual student at IESEG school of management. My passions include cooking, traveling and animals. I hope to open my own restaurant someday for all of you foodies out thereüòù. Before that, I would like to introduce you to my world...

				<h2>Cookingü§≠</h2>
				
					<p>
						I am passionate about cooking. Every week-end, I try a new recipe out: tikka massala with carrot cake accompanied by its mango and tzatsiki sauce. I binge watch "Top Chef" but also "Cauchemar en cuisine".
					</p>

				<h2>Travelingüíö</h2>
				
					<p>
						I've been lucky enough to have visited a fair amount of countries. My favorite is Indonesia: Lombok and Bali. One of my favorite memories was during the world football cup, we played on the beach with the locals. Next year, I will be flying off to Buenos Aires for a 5-month exchange.
					</p>

				<h2>Animalsüôâ</h2>
				
					<p>
						What would be my life without them? Nothing. Since I've become a student, I have subscribed to a lot of dog walking websites. I have two dogs: Folie and Nike. I also have a black and white cat which I cherish a lot: Wifi.
